Hooks are custom scripts that can be integrated into any point within a dialog
to access external or living data. Any information and data that is not part of
the original A.I. training falls under the category `living data`.

## Hook Integration

In order to develop a hook you first need to subclass the `Hook` class from this
library. You need to implement the function `process()` in order to be able to
handle data from the dialog engine.

### Prepare Training Function

During the *training phase* of the artificial intelligence, you will be able to hook
yourself into the process of preparing training data.

During training preparations `prepareTraining` is called with the following parameters:

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|phrases|Object|This is the intent that triggered the hook. This object has a `name` and a `confidence` field.|
|complete|Callback|This is the completion function, complete has to be called with an array parameter. The array must be a list of objects that have the following layout: `{id: <phraseID>, text: <phraseText>}`|

```JavaScript
/**
 *  @param {String} intent Name of the intent that is currently in use
 *  @param {Array} phrases Array that contains all phrasing examples for the intent that triggers this Hook.
 *  @param {Callback} complete Completion callback to continue dialog
 */
prepareTraining(intent, phrases, complete){
    var samples [];

    // go through all phrasings and find the once that we want
    // to manipulate
    for( var i in phrases ){
        if( phrases[i].indexOf("$city") > -1 ){
            samples.push(phrases[i]);
        }
    }

    // return the samples back to the training service
    complete(samples);
}
```

### Process Function

The `process()` function is the heart of the hook, it has the following parameters:

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|intent|Object|This is the intent that triggered the hook. This object has a `name` and a `confidence` field.|
|text|String|This string contains the original phrasing of the user|
|session|Object|The complete user session, including the message thread|
|complete|Callback|This is the completion function, it has to be called at the end of your script in order to continue the dialog.|

 *Additional Variables*
 `this.json` contains the POST request that the user client sent to the chatbot.

### Completion Callback

The completion callback needs to be called at the end of what your
hook is doing. You have to transport at least an `answer` string through
the completion callback. Optionally you can also add a `platform` object
that can hold additional platform information like buttons, images or actions.
Example:

```JavaScript
complete({
    answer: "The cake is a lie!",
    platform: {}
})
```

# Nexus Tools
In the world of the Blackout Nexus, there are some specific standards you need to follow in order to leverage the maximum use of the nexus power. One of those are the so-called `hyperReferences`. What that means is that you can utilise the `hyperReference` objects to reference elements from outside of the scope of your hook. `Links`, `Buttons`, `Carousels`, `MailTos` and `Dialog Buttons` are part of the current array of possible object types for a `hyperReference`.

Another tool that you can utalize is the `platformReactions`, these objects are designed for the platform interface that you are using, to have your personality communicate with humans. The HMI (Human Machine Interface) if you will. `platformReactions` are much more complex as they transport not only context information for the HMI but can also contain telemetry, geometry or odometry data for more complex interfaces.

## Hyper References

There are three ways to use `hyperReferences` in your hook:

1. Use a pre-defined `hyperReference` from within the nexusUi. The only thing you need is the `name` of the `hyperReference` inside your nexus instance.
```JavaScript
    complete({
        answer: "The cake is a lie!",
        platform: {
            hyperReferences: [
                this.getHyperReferenceNamed('Website')
            ]
        }
    })
```

2. Create your own `hyperReference` when you need it. This allows for more flexibility since not every nexus instance will share the same `hyperReferences`
```JavaScript
    complete({
        answer: "The cake is a lie!",
        platform: {
            hyperReferences: [
                {type: "link", blank: true, target: 'http://www.vanschneider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/cake_1200w.jpg', caption: "Get the cake"}
            ]
        }
    })
```

3. Generate a `hyperReference` from existing resources inside of the hook. Assume you have a file in your `templates/` folder called `home.hbs`
```JavaScript
    complete({
        answer: "The cake is a lie!",
        platform: {
            hyperReferences: [
                this.generateHyperReferenceFor('home')
            ]
        }
    })
```

## Platform Reactions

Platform reactions are very specific remote procedure calls from within the nexus. Therefore the only way to gain access to a `platformReaction` is to load one directly from the `Brocas service`.

```JavaScript
    complete({
        answer: "The cake is a lie!",
        platform: {
            platformReactions: [
                this.getPlatformReactionNamed('Wave')
            ]
        }
    })
```

## Handling Hook resources

Each hook can come with it's own resources. JS/CSS files for the browser, Images and even HTML content. Each file must be kept in their respective folder.

```
    [Hook]
        -> index.js (must always be present)
        -> package.json (must always be present)

        -> tests (optional, but encouraged)
            -> myFirstTest.js (optional)

        -> img (optional)
            -> <keep image resources here>

        -> js (optional)
            -> <keep JavaScript resources here>

        -> css (optional)
            -> <keep css resources here>

        -> templates (optional)
            -> <keep hbs resources here>
```

# Simple Example Implementation

```JavaScript
// load the Hook class from this library
const Hook = require('nexus-hook').Hook;

// create your own hook as subclass of Hook
module.exports = class WeatherHook extends Hook {
    /**
     *  @param {Object} intent Object with .name and .confidence
     *  @param {String} text Original phrasing of the user
     *  @param {Callback} complete Completion callback to continue dialog
     */
    process(intent, text, complete){
        // since we already know the phrasing, we can ignore the
        // intent and text parameter
        this.request('GET', 'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Bremen&units=metric&appid=<ID>', {}, (resp) => {
            // after the response from the request-pronise came back
            // complete this hook with an answer string and optionally
            // with a platform object.
            complete({
                answer: 'The weather in Bremen is: '+resp.weather[0].main+" with "+resp.main.temp+" degrees.",
                platform: {}
            });
        });
    }
}
```

# Handling Languages
If you want to provide multilingual support to your hook you can do that with the `languageDict` implementation that comes with the `nexus-hook` library.

Each hook has a member variable called `captions` you can access it via `this.captions`. You can get a language specific phrasing with the `get()` function of the `captions` object.

In order to have a working language dictionary, you need to create a file called `languageDict.json` in the root folder of your hook.

## Example languageDict File

```json
{
    "de": {
        "fallback": "Ich habe keine informationen zu deiner Suche gefunden",
        "weatherAnswer": "Das Wetter in $city ist $weather mit $temperature grad"
    },
    "en": {
        "fallback": "Sorry, I can't find anything.",
        "weatherAnswer": "The weather in $city is $weather with $temperature degrees"
    }
}
```

If the setup of the `languageDict.json` was done correctly, you will be able to access any caption with the `get()` function passing the name of the caption as a string.

## Example Usage
```JavaScript
this.captions.get('fallback'); // in the above example will return:  "Sorry, I can't find anything." if the language is english
```

# Testing
The integrations in the `nexusUi` as of version <= *2.0.0* will not support error feedback. In order to test your hook, you can utilize the `TestHook` class of the `nexus-hook` library.

The `TestHook` class has only one function called `chat` the prototype of the chat function looks like this:

```JavaScript
chat(intent, text, complete)
```

You will have to pass an intent name and a text to the chat function of the `TestHook` class. The response will then be returned through the complete callback.

The rest of the hook will behave exacly the same as it would, when you integrate it into the `nexusUi`.

## Example

```JavaScript
// Test implementation
const Hook = require('nexus-hook').TestHook;
var myHook = new Hook("en");

// run the test hook with the test parameters
myHook.chat("weahter_intent", "whats the weather like in Bremen", (resp) => {
    console.log(resp.answer);
});
```

## Example Output
```
=== Testing Hook ===
Weather hook v0.1.0 loaded
Sorry, I can't find anything.
The weather in KÃ¶ln is Clouds with $20.6 degrees
The weather in Bremen is Clouds with $18.43 degrees
The weather in Hamburg is Clouds with $18.6 degrees
Weather hook v0.1.0 loaded
Ich habe keine informationen zu deiner Suche gefunden
Das Wetter in Bremen ist Clouds mit $18.43 grad
Das Wetter in Hamburg ist Clouds mit $18.61 grad
Das Wetter in KÃ¶ln ist Clouds mit $20.6 grad
```
